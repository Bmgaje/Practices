    question: "How does photosynthesis work?",
    answer:
      "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the aid of chlorophyll pigments. It involves converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, with the formula: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy = C6H12O6 + 6O2.",

    question: "What causes seasons on Earth?",
    answer:
      "Seasons on Earth are caused by the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis away or toward the Sun as it travels through its year-long path around the Sun. This axial tilt means that during different times of the year, different parts of the Earth receive varying amounts of sunlight, leading to seasonal changes.",

    question: "Why is the sky blue?",
    answer:
      "The sky appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by the molecules in the atmosphere. This scattering, known as Rayleigh scattering, is more effective at shorter wavelengths (the blue end of the visible spectrum). Thus, blue light is scattered in all directions, making the sky appear blue when we look up.",

    question: "What is the theory of evolution?",
    answer:
      "The theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin, suggests that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. This theory explains the diversity of life and is supported by extensive evidence from a wide range of scientific disciplines.",

    question: "How do vaccines work?",
    answer:
      "Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. They typically contain a weakened or inactive part of the organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response. This prepares the body to recognize and combat the real pathogen if exposed in the future, thereby preventing the disease.",
